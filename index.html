                    Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel has been confirmed to be the strongest character in the MCU thanks to her powers which she received from the tesseract. Despite only appearing in 2 films so far, her feats have already been on display.

                <h2>Hawkeye</h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that he's on a much different level than the rest of the team is one of the best parts of the character and grounds him especially since it's clear he has a lot more to lose than them. Him being able to hold his own in battle just goes to show just how good of a fighter he is.

                    Dr. Stephen Strange was trained by the Ancient One in Kamar-Taj and became the guardian of the New York Sanctum Sanctorum after the death of Daniel Drumm. With minimal training, Strange was able to take on Kaecilius and his group of zealots as well as create a time loop strong enough to trap Dormammu for an infinite amount of time.
